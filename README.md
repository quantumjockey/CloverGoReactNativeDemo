# CloverGo react-native Demo

An attempt at running the CloverGo SDK in a react-native app during the CNN Money 20/20 Hackathon 2016 (Las Vegas, NV). I thought it was a fairly straightforward goal at first, but hit many interesting roadblocks along the way. This is as far as I got. Learned quite a bit though!
